## Frameworks
Our frameworks are the building blocks that enable us to create robust, efficient, and maintainable software solutions. They have been carefully selected to complement our tech stack and address specific development challenges we face in our projects.

These frameworks enhance our development process by providing tried-and-tested solutions to common problems, allowing our team to focus on building unique features and business logic. Each framework has been chosen for its ability to integrate seamlessly with our tech stack, its community support, and its alignment with our development principles.

We use the following frameworks in this project:

Backend:
- **Mediator**: A behavioral design pattern that helps reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. It allows loose coupling by encapsulating object interaction.
  - Git: https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR
- **Automapper**: A convention-based object-object mapper that simplifies the process of mapping one object to another.
  - Git: https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper
- **Rebus**: A lean service bus implementation for .NET, providing a simple and flexible way to do messaging and queueing in .NET applications.
  - Git: https://github.com/rebus-org/Rebus

Testing:
- **Faker**: A library for generating fake data for testing purposes, allowing for more realistic and diverse test scenarios.
  - Git: https://github.com/bchavez/Bogus
- **NSubstitute**: A friendly substitute for .NET mocking libraries, used for creating test doubles in unit testing.
  - Git: https://github.com/nsubstitute/NSubstitute

Database:
- **EF Core**: Entity Framework Core, a lightweight, extensible, and cross-platform version of Entity Framework, used for data access and object-relational mapping.
  - Git: https://github.com/dotnet/efcore
